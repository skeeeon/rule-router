# templates/signature-verification.yaml
#
# A rule that demonstrates cryptographic signature verification.
# It only processes the message if it has a valid NKey signature.
# This is critical for secure, privileged operations.
#
# Example Use Case: A command to unlock a door, which must be authenticated.
#
- trigger:
    nats:
      subject: "commands.secure.door.unlock"
  conditions:
    operator: and
    items:
      # 1. Verify the signature is valid.
      - field: "{@signature.valid}"
        operator: eq
        value: true

      # 2. (Recommended) Prevent replay attacks by checking the timestamp.
      #    This requires the message payload to have a 'timestamp' field (Unix seconds).
      - field: "{timestamp}"
        operator: recent
        value: "10s" # Message must be recent (e.g., within 10 seconds).

      # 3. (Optional) Authorize the signer's public key against a KV store.
      - field: "{@kv.access_control.{@signature.pubkey}:status}"
        operator: eq
